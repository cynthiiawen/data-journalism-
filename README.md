I picked the question above because I feel like it is quite controversial and wanted to see respondant's opinions on the topic. On one hand, people can argue that they paid for their seats and it is rude for someone to ask them to move to a different seat they didn't pay for. However, people can also emphatize with wanting to stick with their family.

As depicted on the chart, 83% of survey respondants noted that it is not rude to ask someone to switch seats to be closer to family, while about 17% of them found it to be rude. Out of this 17%, the majority of respondants (about 86%) found the request to be somewhat rude while the rest found it to be very rude. These results surprised me because on social media, I note that a lot of people dislike people asking them to move seats and often will refuse to comply to such a request.
